# Loti
We proudly introduce you Loti, the easiest way to remind your day. 

## Problem define
* Nowadays, people use varying scheduling platforms from google calendar to time tree to manage their schedules. However, there always existed inconvenience with theses. We use calendar to organize schedule to keep location and time of an event, but we use maps to get a direction to our destination. So every time there is an event, we open our calendar app, retrieve location information, and open again maps app to find a direction to desired destination. This process will repeat indefinteily for all of your events, unless you have Loti.
